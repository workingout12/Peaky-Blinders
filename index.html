His fateful meeting with British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley, played with adroitness by Sam Claflin (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay), led to his infiltration of the British Union of Fascists, a failed assassination attempt, and by the series' end, the exacting of revenge on Michael (Finn Cole) for his loss of Tommy's fortune, and many more things besides.</p>
